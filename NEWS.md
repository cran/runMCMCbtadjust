# runMCMCbtadjust 1.1.1

Major revisions:
- Added 1000 to control$time.max/Nchains in timeout argument to avoid "error reading from connection"; then replaced timeout = min(5184000,control$time.max/Nchains+1000) by timeout = ifelse(is.finite(control$time.max), 3*control$time.max+3600,30*24*3600) to have a maximum length of 30 days in case time.max is unspecified and allowing extra-time for WAIC & extra-calculations otherwise.
- Modified multiplier of Nchains in set.seed in sections 2 and greater - using Ncycles to avoid repeated same values
- Changed formula for niter related to duration/time to promote reproducibility in case of time.max not reached
- Changed the way control$check.thinmult behaves by adding a third level and changing the default - to conserve neffs.reached & convergence if they occurred prior to change
- Changed the beginning of sections 2.3 & 2.5.3 - "Reshaping samplesList" sections -  to better control samples and iterations being controlled from the end of the Markov chains
- Added code for controlling sees in case of parallelization (control.MCMC$parallelize), for reproducibility issues: seeds <- getseeds(Nchains, control$seed); results.temp <- parallel::clusterApply(cl, seeds, worker.seed), with specifications of functions getseeds and worker.seed.
- Added function window.seq to allow coherence with modifications in 2.3 and 2.5.3 and used it instead of window (in case thin was specified)
- Added arguments decrease.thinmult.multiplier and decrease.thinmult.threshold to control and changed the formula for thinmult decrease when adapting it from thinmult<-thinmult-1 to thinmult<-ifelse(thinmult>control$decrease.thinmult.threshold, max(floor(control$decrease.thinmult.multiplier*thinmult), control$decrease.thinmult.threshold),thinmult-1)
- Added time.MCMC.Preparation.num and shifted time-dependent formulas for niter from (control$time.max-duration)*0.95 to (control$time.max-duration)*max(0.5,time.MCMC.num/(duration-time.MCMC.Preparation.num)), so that control$time.max is the targeted maximum time
- Added two vignettes to give expanations on two specific points: changing samplers with Nimble and doing extra-calaulcations with Nimble

Minor revisions:
- Put back the call to library instead of requireNamespace in parallelizeInitExpr to avoid some problems.
- Added a stop of the program if parallelize and library parallel is not loaded. Updated help accordingly.
- Changed error message if APT and Nimble and not parallelized, and nimbleAPT is not loaded
- Revised burnin in the output - in case of non-convergence - and revised thinning of result in case of non-convergence - to ensure proper resizing
- Revised 2.5 section and especially 2.5.2 to reduce number of samples in case of convergence - done also if not check.thinmult; associated changes in checking.neffs.conserved and in section 2.1 for thin in case niter<0
- Removed a print command in 2.5.2 that was there just for diagnosing
- Corrected calculate.thinmult.target function to have a maximum value that thinmult cannot overcome so that there are at least 10 values left in each Markov Chain.
- Shifted index.conv.local<-index.conv.temp to index.conv.local<-indices.samplesList[index.conv.temp] before conveff_final calls due to burnin problems with conveff_final
- Slight changes in the first Vignette
- Slight changes in the text of the help
- Changed default and help for component check.convergence.firstrun of control
- Changed the error message in case names of control or control.MCMC do not match those in the function, to be more informative
- Changed final thin multiplier section to make check.thinmult more active: added if else in: stop_decrease<-convergedtemp&neffs.reachedtemp&ifelse(control$check.thinmult==3,neffs.conserved,TRUE)&min.Nvalues.OK
- Changed examples in functions runMCMC_btadjust and findMCMC_strong_corrs: not running them - due to duration constraints on CRAN - and removing condition
- Replaced: nu.burn=nburnin.min+sum(numIter.samplesList[1:(index.conv.local-1)]) by: nu.burn= nburnin.min0+sum(numIter.samplesList[1:(index.conv.local-1)]) for nu.burn to be better estimated with Jags.
- Added printing messages at the end of MCMC sampling and at the beginning of WAIC sampling; Added printing of extra-calculation phase - otherwise silent…
- Added components Nvalues, neff.min & neff.median in final.params component of the attributes of the output
- Introduced arguments monitorParentNodes and monitorAllStochNodes in control.MCMC and slight changes in params, params.conv & params.save
- Added argument conveff.final.allparams to control with a default to TRUE and changed the conveff_final function and its calls accordingly. Behavior in previous versions corresponded to conveff.final.allparams=FALSE in case of MCMC convergence.
- Added arguments force.niter.max and force.time.max (respectively time.max.turns.off.niter.max) to control with a default to FALSE to be able to force the MCMC to go to niter.max (for force.niter.max) and control$time.max (for force.time.max) (provided control$time.max constraints and niter.max contrainsts are met) (resp. to disable niter.max - except if in force.niter.max or force.time.max phase - if control$time.max is specified).
- In section 2 - for in thinmult adaptations - turned samplesList to samplesList.temp & adapted related indices for diagstemp and minNvalues.OK calculations.

# runMCMCbtadjust 1.0.5

- Correction of a bug in the section 2.1 section of the code for the calculation of the new number of iterations: the number of iterations was too small when thin.max was reached (acknowledged with thin.max=1): replaced thin by thin.theoretical (which has been introduced at the beginning or section 2.1); replaced (index.conv-1) by ifelse(converged,index.conv-1,size.samplesList) in final calculations of durations. Otherwise, erroneous in case of non convergence..
- Made corrections regarding how control$seed was treated: (i) added the possibility that control$seed could be NULL - in which case there is no control of seeds for MCMCs; (ii) put the default to NULL instead of 1; (iii) in case length(control$seed) was 1, added set.seed(NULL) at the end to not constrain the seed of the R environment after the end of the function by the seed used in the function.
- Added neffs.reached in the final.params component of the attributes of the result; added help for final.params$converged and final.params$neffs.reached
- Allowed control.MCMC$n.adapt to also apply in case Nimble was the MCMC.language; changed the default value accordingly (so that it is in the program 1000 in case Jags is used and 0 in case Nimble is used); corrected an error in the inclusion of n.adapt in duration.MCMC.transient in case Jags is used.

# runMCMCbtadjust 1.0.4

- Replaced (index.conv-1) by ifelse(converged,index.conv-1,size.samplesList) in final calculations of durations. Otherwise, erroneous in case of non convergence..

---

# runMCMCbtadjust 1.0.1

- Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
- Changed title of package - referring to 'JAGS', 'nimble' or 'greta' explicitly
- Changed function runMCMC_btadjust(): placing neff.max at the beginning, replacing neffmax by neff.max in functions scale.available.neffs & calculate.thinmult.target, adding warnings if niter.max is finite and niter.max/thin.max is greater than 3*neff.max
- Replaced niter>0 by niter>=thin in sections 2 and 2.2 in function runMCMC_btadjust(), to avoid a bug
- Slight changes to the vignette named 'runMCMCbtadjust_Presentation'
